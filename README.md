# mips-assembler
MIPS assembler under development for learning purposes.

For now, it is capable of compiling any basic instruction from the MIPS instruction set, but the "label" field has to be numeric.

## Running
For it to run properly, you must compile mips.c and have an "assembly.asm" file with valid instructions. The terminal will return the equivalent machine code in hex.

It does not have error handling yet, so keep in mind your assembly code **must be valid**.
