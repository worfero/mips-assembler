# mips-assembler
MIPS assembler under development for learning purposes.

It is still at the very beginning stage of development. For now, it is only capable of processing one line of assembly code, restricted to "addi", "lw" and "lui" instructions.

## Running
For it to run properly, you must compile mips.c and have an "assembly.txt" file with a valid instruction. The terminal will return the equivalent machine code in hex.
