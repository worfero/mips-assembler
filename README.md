# mips-assembler
MIPS assembler under development for learning purposes.

You must compile the mips.c file in order to run it.

It is still at the very beginning stage of development so the only thing it does is parsing any "addi" instruction written in the terminal and returning the machine code hex value as a string.

Example: "addi $s0 $0 40" returns "0x20100028"
