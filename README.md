# mips-assembler
MIPS assembler under development for learning purposes.

It is capable of compiling any basic instruction from the MIPS instruction set.

It also ignores empty or blank lines of instruction, so if you like to use line breaks in your assembly code, feel free.

## Running
For it to run properly, you must have an .asm file with valid assembly code in the src folder. The program will generate a "machine-code.bin" file in the build folder containing the binary instructions. Also, the terminal will return the equivalent code in hex.

I also decided to include an assembly.asm file with testbench instructions for a MIPS processor in the repo so you have a test file already.

It does not have error handling yet, so keep in mind your assembly code **must be valid**.
